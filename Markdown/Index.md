# Jupyter Site

JupyterSite allows you to easily build a suite of rendered documents from Jupyter
notebooks. Jupyter notebooks go in, html/markdown pages, PDFs, slideshows, and tex
comes out. If you use this in a Github repository, it will even build a Github pages
site. This also shows how to make the notebooks easily accessible in Julia.

It just takes one button, simplifying the entire process. The `publish.sh` file
does all the heavy lifting, showing you how to do all of this (any of the conversions
can be disabled by commenting out the appropriate lines).
